# Migration 010: Organizations Multi-Tenant Architecture Guide

## üìã Overview

This migration transforms the Community SaaS from a single-tenant system to a complete multi-tenant architecture with **organizations** as the root isolation level.

### üèóÔ∏è New Architecture Hierarchy
```
Organizations (Property Management Companies)
    ‚Üì
Communities (Residential Communities) 
    ‚Üì
Users (Residents, Managers, Admins)
    ‚Üì
Incidents (Issues/Tickets)
```

## üéØ What This Migration Does

### ‚úÖ Core Changes
1. **Creates `organizations` table** as the tenant root
2. **Adds `organization_id` foreign key** to all existing tables:
   - `communities.organization_id`
   - `user_roles.organization_id` 
   - `incidents.organization_id`
3. **Migrates existing data** to a default organization
4. **Updates all RLS policies** for complete tenant isolation
5. **Creates helper views and functions** for organization management

### üîí Security Model
- **Organization Owners**: See all data within their organization
- **Community Managers**: See data from their specific communities
- **Residents**: See only their community data
- **Complete isolation**: Organizations cannot access each other's data

## üöÄ Pre-Migration Checklist

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Requirements
- [ ] **Backup database** - This migration modifies core tables
- [ ] **Verify admin user exists**: `sergioariasf@gmail.com` must exist in `auth.users`
- [ ] **Test in development** environment first
- [ ] **Maintenance window** - Plan for brief downtime during migration

### üìä Pre-Migration Verification
```sql
-- Check current data counts
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM communities) as communities,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_roles) as user_roles,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM incidents) as incidents,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'sergioariasf@gmail.com') as admin_exists;
```

## üîß Migration Steps

### Step 1: Apply Migration
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /home/sergi/proyectos/community-saas

# Apply the migration using Supabase CLI
supabase db push --include-all

# OR apply directly in Supabase SQL Editor
# Copy and paste the contents of 010_create_organizations_multi_tenant.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration Success
```sql
-- Check migration results
SELECT * FROM organization_dashboard;

-- Verify no orphaned records
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM communities WHERE organization_id IS NULL) as orphaned_communities,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_roles WHERE organization_id IS NULL) as orphaned_roles,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM incidents WHERE organization_id IS NULL) as orphaned_incidents;
```

### Step 3: Test Multi-Tenant Isolation
```sql
-- Test organization access
SELECT can_access_organization('your-org-id-here');

-- Test data visibility 
SELECT * FROM incidents_summary;
```

## üìä Post-Migration Verification

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
1. **All tables have `organization_id`** columns (NOT NULL)
2. **Default organization created** with all existing data
3. **RLS policies active** on all tables
4. **No orphaned records** (organization_id IS NULL)
5. **Helper views accessible** to authenticated users

### üîç Verification Queries
```sql
-- 1. Check table structure
\d organizations
\d communities 
\d user_roles
\d incidents

-- 2. Verify default organization created
SELECT * FROM organizations ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 1;

-- 3. Check data migration
SELECT 
  o.name as organization,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) as communities,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ur.id) as user_roles,
  COUNT(DISTINCT i.id) as incidents
FROM organizations o
LEFT JOIN communities c ON o.id = c.organization_id
LEFT JOIN user_roles ur ON o.id = ur.organization_id  
LEFT JOIN incidents i ON o.id = i.organization_id
GROUP BY o.id, o.name;

-- 4. Test RLS policies
SET ROLE authenticated;
SELECT * FROM organization_dashboard;
```

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Emergency Rollback (if needed)

```sql
-- CAUTION: This will undo all multi-tenant changes
BEGIN;

-- 1. Drop organization foreign key constraints
ALTER TABLE communities DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS communities_organization_id_fkey;
ALTER TABLE user_roles DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS user_roles_organization_id_fkey;
ALTER TABLE incidents DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS incidents_organization_id_fkey;

-- 2. Remove organization_id columns
ALTER TABLE communities DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id;
ALTER TABLE user_roles DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id;
ALTER TABLE incidents DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id;

-- 3. Drop organizations table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS organizations CASCADE;

-- 4. Restore original RLS policies (you'll need to manually recreate these)
-- See migration 008 for original incident policies

-- 5. Drop helper functions and views
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS organization_dashboard;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_user_organization_id();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS can_access_organization(UUID);

-- Only commit if you're absolutely sure
-- COMMIT;
ROLLBACK; -- Use this to safely test the rollback
```

## üîß Application Updates Required

### üé® Frontend/TypeScript Changes

The migration creates new database schema that requires updating TypeScript types:

```typescript
// Update src/lib/database.types.ts
export interface Organization {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  owner_id: string;
  contact_email?: string;
  subscription_plan: 'basic' | 'premium' | 'enterprise';
  max_communities: number;
  max_users_per_community: number;
  is_active: boolean;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

// Update existing interfaces to include organization_id
export interface Community {
  id: string;
  organization_id: string; // NEW FIELD
  name: string;
  // ... rest of fields
}

export interface UserRole {
  id: string;
  organization_id: string; // NEW FIELD  
  user_id: string;
  community_id?: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'manager' | 'resident';
  // ... rest of fields
}

export interface Incident {
  id: string;
  organization_id: string; // NEW FIELD
  community_id: string;
  title: string;
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

### üéØ API/Query Updates
All queries that fetch communities, user_roles, or incidents now automatically filter by organization due to RLS policies. However, you may want to explicitly include organization context:

```typescript
// Example: Get communities for current user's organization
const { data: communities } = await supabase
  .from('communities')
  .select('*')
  .order('name');

// The RLS policies will automatically filter by organization
// No code changes required for basic CRUD operations!
```

### üè† Organization Management UI
You'll want to create organization management interfaces:

1. **Organization Dashboard** - Use the `organization_dashboard` view
2. **Organization Settings** - Allow editing organization details
3. **User Invitation** - Invite users to specific organizations
4. **Community Creation** - Create communities within organization scope

## üìà Performance Considerations

### ‚úÖ Optimization Features Added
1. **Database indexes** on all `organization_id` foreign keys
2. **Efficient RLS policies** using EXISTS clauses
3. **Materialized organization dashboard** view for metrics
4. **Helper functions** to avoid repeated queries

### üîç Monitor Performance
```sql
-- Check index usage
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  indexname,
  idx_scan as times_used
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE indexname LIKE '%organization%'
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- Monitor slow queries
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE query LIKE '%organization%'
ORDER BY total_time DESC;
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

### üîí RLS Policy Summary
- **Organizations**: Only owners can manage, users can view their own
- **Communities**: Organization-scoped access based on user roles
- **User Roles**: Organization owners control all roles, users see their scope
- **Incidents**: Complete isolation by organization with role-based access

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations
1. **Organization isolation is enforced** at the database level
2. **Cross-tenant data access is impossible** through normal queries
3. **Super admin access** can be granted via global roles (community_id IS NULL, organization_id IS NULL)
4. **All policies use SECURITY DEFINER** functions where appropriate

## üéâ Migration Benefits

### ‚úÖ Achieved Goals
1. **Complete tenant isolation** - Organizations cannot access each other's data
2. **Scalable architecture** - Support for hundreds of property management companies
3. **Backward compatibility** - Existing application code continues to work
4. **Performance optimized** - Proper indexing and efficient RLS policies
5. **Security first** - Database-level enforcement of multi-tenancy
6. **Easy management** - Helper views and functions for administration

### üìä Metrics & Monitoring
Use the `organization_dashboard` view to monitor:
- Organization growth
- Community counts per organization
- User engagement per organization
- Incident volumes and resolution rates

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Admin user not found"** - Ensure `sergioariasf@gmail.com` exists in auth.users
2. **"Permission denied"** - Check RLS policies are applied correctly
3. **"Orphaned records"** - Run verification queries to check data integrity
4. **"Performance issues"** - Check indexes are created properly

### Debug Queries
```sql
-- Check user permissions
SELECT * FROM debug_user_permissions();

-- Verify organization access
SELECT can_access_organization(get_user_organization_id());

-- Check policy effectiveness
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT * FROM incidents WHERE organization_id = 'your-org-id';
```
